Welcome to my GitHub page!
Here are some projects I am currently working on:

- [Luojia1 Cloud Detection](https://github.com/DEDZTBH/luojia1-cloud-detection): Detect cloud in nighttime images from Luojia-1 satellite using basic filters.
- [A Tour of Color Temperature](https://dedztbh.github.io/a-tour-of-color-temperature): A website that demonstrates different color temperatures and tells you why we should use warmer colors at night. Repo [here](https://github.com/DEDZTBH/a-tour-of-color-temperature).
